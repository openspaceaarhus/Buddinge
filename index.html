    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    
    <img src="assets/car.png"/>
    
    <p>You control the car with the arrow keys:</p>    
    
    <ul>
        <li>Up: Accelerate</li>
        <li>Down: Break / Reverse</li>
        <li>Left: Turn counter clockwise</li>
        <li>Right: Turn clockwise</li>
        <li>Space: Roll out (more) cable</li>
    </ul>
    
    The game play goes like this
    <ol>
        <li>Blue dots will appear in front of the two buildings that needs to be connected. <img src="assets/hep.png"/></li>
        <li>Drive to the lawn in front of one of the marked houses</li>
        <li>Press and hold space to roll out some cable</li>
        <li>Drive to the lawn in front of the other marked house</li>
        <li>A connection will be made and you gain some points and some extra time</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Notice that the amount of cable is limited, so do not roll out too much.</p>
    <P>There is also limited time to make the connection, so hurry up! </p>

    <p>You can collect powerups along the way</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><img src="assets/powerup1.png" style="vertical-align: middle"/>Extra cable</li>
        <li><img src="assets/powerup2.png" style="vertical-align: middle"/>More speed</li>
    </ul>
